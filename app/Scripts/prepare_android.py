"""Prepare the generated engine sources for an Android build from your game files.

This is the Linux/NDK counterpart of the upstream app/Scripts/prepare.py. It runs
the same patched-wasm2c pipeline to turn b/<build>/game.wasm into the C sources
(Generated/game_*.c + game.h) that the vendored engine core compiles against.

Differences from the iOS script, all deliberate:
  - no Apple-Silicon check, no xcrun/xcodebuild, no Metal shader step (the Vulkan
    renderer does not exist yet, so there is nothing to precompile shaders into)
  - wabt and simde are fetched for the host platform
  - output is a CMake source list consumed by android/app/CMakeLists.txt

It reuses the upstream patch scripts verbatim so the generated code matches the
pinned engine exactly. Run on Linux (CI) with the game mirror available.

Usage: python3 prepare_android.py --mirror /path/to/game-folder
